## A Crowded Orbit

Earth's orbital environment is getting crowded. As of 2026, over 36,000 objects larger than 10 centimeters are tracked by space surveillance networks. Millions more fragments — too small to track but large enough to damage spacecraft — orbit at velocities exceeding 28,000 km/h.

Every satellite launch adds to this population. Every collision creates thousands of new fragments. The math is unforgiving: without active intervention, certain orbital regions could become unusable within decades.

## The Kessler Syndrome

In 1978, NASA scientist Donald Kessler proposed a scenario where cascading collisions in orbit could create an exponentially growing debris field. This "Kessler Syndrome" isn't a distant theoretical concern — some scientists believe it has already begun in certain orbital altitudes.

The implications are staggering. GPS navigation, weather forecasting, telecommunications, Earth observation for climate science — all depend on safe access to orbit.

## What the Industry Is Doing

The space industry is responding on multiple fronts:

### Active Debris Removal (ADR)
Companies like Astroscale, ClearSpace, and others are developing spacecraft capable of capturing and deorbiting defunct satellites and large debris objects. These missions represent the cutting edge of orbital robotics.

### Space Situational Awareness (SSA)
Better tracking means better collision avoidance. New radar systems, optical telescopes, and on-orbit sensors are dramatically improving our ability to monitor the orbital environment.

### Design for Demise
Future satellites are being designed with end-of-life disposal in mind — lower orbits that ensure natural reentry, drag sails, and deorbiting propulsion systems.

### Regulation and Standards
International guidelines now require operators to deorbit spacecraft within 25 years of mission completion. Some agencies are pushing for even shorter timelines.

## Our Role

At Journals, we believe software is the key enabler for solving the debris challenge. From autonomous navigation systems for ADR missions to predictive analytics for collision avoidance, the tools we build help make space operations safer and more sustainable.

The orbital environment is a shared resource. Protecting it requires collaboration across governments, operators, and technology providers. We're proud to be part of that effort.
