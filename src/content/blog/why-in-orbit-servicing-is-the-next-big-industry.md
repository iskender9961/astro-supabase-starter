## The Problem with Disposable Satellites

A geostationary communications satellite costs between $150 million and $400 million to build and launch. Most are designed for a 15-year operational life. When they run out of fuel — even if every other system is functioning perfectly — they're retired and replaced.

This is like scrapping a perfectly good car because the fuel tank is empty.

## Enter In-Orbit Servicing

In-orbit servicing (IOS) encompasses a range of capabilities:

- **Life Extension** — Attaching a service vehicle to a satellite to provide station-keeping propulsion, potentially adding 5-15 years of operational life.
- **Inspection** — Close-proximity observation of spacecraft to diagnose anomalies without physical contact.
- **Repair and Upgrade** — Future capabilities include replacing components, updating hardware, and refueling.
- **Relocation** — Moving satellites to different orbital slots as business needs change.

## The Economics Are Compelling

The business case for life extension alone is straightforward. If a GEO satellite generates $50-100 million in annual revenue, extending its life by even five years represents $250-500 million in additional value — far exceeding the cost of a servicing mission.

For satellite operators, this transforms the financial model from "build, launch, replace" to "build, launch, maintain, extend."

## Technical Challenges

In-orbit servicing isn't easy. It requires:

1. **Autonomous rendezvous and proximity operations** — approaching a client satellite safely, often one that wasn't designed to be serviced.
2. **Precision docking** — connecting to a spacecraft at centimeter-level accuracy.
3. **Robust flight software** — handling edge cases in an environment where mistakes are measured in millions of dollars.
4. **Regulatory frameworks** — establishing rules for who can approach whose satellite, and under what conditions.

## The Software Layer

Behind every servicing mission is a sophisticated software stack: mission planning tools, autonomous guidance algorithms, telemetry processing systems, and ground segment operations platforms.

This is where companies like Journals come in. We focus on building the software infrastructure that makes these missions possible — reliable, tested, and ready for the demands of orbital operations.

## Looking Ahead

The in-orbit servicing market is projected to grow to $4.4 billion by 2030. The first commercial missions are already underway. As the technology matures and costs decrease, servicing will become standard practice — not just for the largest satellites, but across the entire orbital ecosystem.

We're building for that future.
